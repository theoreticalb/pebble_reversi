Readme

This is an implementation of Reversi for the Pebble watch.

Todo:

A/B pruning: It's implemented, but doesn't seem to work right and needs to be turned back on.
AI improvements: Negatively count squares adjacent to corners?
L4 AI featuring monte carlo simulations on high-performing leaf nodes?
Transposition table?

Cleanup: should separate out the settings and reversi logic from the main logic, physically if not logically.  Shouldn't be TOO hard, I don't think. It's cleaner than it looks. ;-)   

Features:
Pausing AI-Play on entering menu?
Auto-skip for AI?
First-player AI (so the human moves second)?
